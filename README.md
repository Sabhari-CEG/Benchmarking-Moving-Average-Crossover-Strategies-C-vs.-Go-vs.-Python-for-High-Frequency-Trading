Algorithmic Trading Simulator with Backtesting
Problem Statement
This project implements an Algorithmic Trading Simulator with Backtesting capabilities. The goal is to analyze historical stock price data, calculate moving averages, and generate buy/sell signals based on a simple moving average crossover strategy.
Dataset
The dataset used is historical stock price data for Meta (formerly Facebook), structured as follows:
text
timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
30-09-2022 04:00,136.82,136.82,136.82,136.82,100
30-09-2022 04:01,137.77,137.79,137.77,137.77,400
30-09-2022 04:05,137.59,137.59,137.59,137.59,100
...

The dataset contains 162,280 rows and 6 columns, providing minute-by-minute trading data.
Algorithm Overview
The core algorithm consists of two main components:
Simple Moving Average (SMA) Calculation:
Function: calculateSMA
Calculates the average price over a specified period.
Moving Average Crossover Strategy:
Function: movingAverageCrossover
Generates buy signals when the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA.
Generates sell signals when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.
Implementation in Different Languages
C++ Implementation
The C++ implementation focuses on optimizing performance and memory usage:
Uses std::vector for efficient data storage and manipulation.
Employs std::accumulate for initial sum calculation in SMA.
Utilizes in-place vector operations to minimize memory allocations.
Implements efficient CSV parsing with minimal string operations.
Key optimizations:
Pre-allocation of vectors to avoid reallocation.
Use of references to avoid unnecessary copying.
Employs C++11 features for improved performance.
Execution time: ~20 seconds
Go Implementation
The Go implementation leverages Go's simplicity and built-in features:
Uses slices for data storage, similar to C++'s vectors.
Implements simple and straightforward SMA and crossover calculations.
Utilizes Go's efficient built-in CSV parsing capabilities.
While not using goroutines in this specific implementation, Go's potential for concurrent processing is notable for larger datasets or more complex strategies.
Execution time: ~2.3 seconds
Python Implementation
The Python implementation showcases the power of specialized libraries:
Utilizes pandas for efficient data loading and manipulation.
Leverages NumPy for high-performance numerical computations.
Employs vectorized operations for SMA calculation and signal generation.
Key optimizations:
Uses np.cumsum for efficient cumulative sum calculation.
Employs boolean array operations for crossover detection.
Utilizes np.where for efficient signal index identification.
Execution time: ~0.13 seconds
Performance Comparison
Language	Execution Time (s)	Key Advantages
C++	~20	Fine-grained control, potential for further optimization
Go	~2.3	Good balance of performance and simplicity
Python	~0.13	Fastest execution, leveraging optimized libraries
Analysis
C++ Performance: While C++ typically offers the highest performance, the current implementation is significantly slower. This suggests potential for optimization, possibly in the CSV parsing or memory management.
Go's Efficiency: Go provides a good balance between performance and code simplicity. Its standard library and garbage collection contribute to clean, efficient code.
Python's Superiority: Python's performance is surprisingly superior, primarily due to the use of highly optimized NumPy and pandas libraries. These libraries implement low-level, vectorized operations that outperform manual implementations in other languages.
Library vs. Manual Implementation: The Python implementation demonstrates the power of using specialized, optimized libraries over manual implementations. The NumPy and pandas libraries are written in C, offering C-like performance with Python's ease of use.
Potential for Improvement: Both C++ and Go implementations could potentially be optimized further, possibly by implementing similar vectorized operations or by leveraging parallel processing capabilities.
Conclusion
This project highlights the trade-offs between different programming languages for algorithmic trading simulations. While C++ offers fine-grained control, and Go provides a good balance of performance and simplicity, Python's specialized libraries make it an excellent choice for rapid development and high performance in data-intensive financial applications.
The results underscore the importance of choosing the right tools and libraries for specific tasks in algorithmic trading, where both performance and development efficiency are crucial.
