# Comparative Analysis of High-Performance Algorithmic Trading Implementations

## üìä Problem Statement

This project implements an Algorithmic Trading Simulator with Backtesting capabilities. The goal is to analyze historical stock price data, calculate moving averages, and generate buy/sell signals based on a simple moving average crossover strategy.

## üìà Dataset

The dataset used is historical stock price data for Meta (formerly Facebook), structured as follows:

timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
30-09-2022 04:00,136.82,136.82,136.82,136.82,100
30-09-2022 04:01,137.77,137.79,137.77,137.77,400
30-09-2022 04:05,137.59,137.59,137.59,137.59,100


- **Size**: 162,280 rows x 6 columns
- **Frequency**: Minute-by-minute trading data

## üßÆ Algorithm Overview

The core algorithm consists of two main components:

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA) Calculation**
   - Function: `calculateSMA`
   - Purpose: Calculates the average price over a specified period

2. **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**
   - Function: `movingAverageCrossover`
   - Signals:
     - Buy: Short-term SMA crosses above long-term SMA
     - Sell: Short-term SMA crosses below long-term SMA

## üíª Implementation in Different Languages

### C++ Implementation

Focuses on optimizing performance and memory usage:

- Uses `std::vector` for efficient data storage
- Employs `std::accumulate` for initial sum calculation in SMA
- Utilizes in-place vector operations to minimize memory allocations
- Implements efficient CSV parsing with minimal string operations

**Key optimizations:**
- Pre-allocation of vectors to avoid reallocation
- Use of references to avoid unnecessary copying
- Employs C++11 features for improved performance

**Execution time:** ~20 seconds

### Go Implementation

Leverages Go's simplicity and built-in features for concurrent processing:

- Uses slices for efficient data storage and manipulation
- Implements SMA calculation and crossover detection
- Utilizes Go's efficient built-in file I/O and string parsing capabilities
- Employs goroutines for parallel processing of data chunks

**Key features:**
- Concurrent processing using goroutines
- Efficient inter-goroutine communication with channels
- Dynamic workload distribution across multiple CPU cores
- Balanced between code readability and performance optimization

**Implementation details:**
1. **Data Loading**: 
   - Reads CSV file using `bufio.Scanner` for efficient I/O
   - Parses closing prices into a slice of float64

2. **SMA Calculation** (`calculateSMA` function):
   - Efficiently calculates Simple Moving Average
   - Uses a sliding window approach to minimize redundant calculations

3. **Moving Average Crossover** (`movingAverageCrossover` function):
   - Detects crossovers between short-term and long-term SMAs
   - Generates buy/sell signals based on crossover events
   - Sends signals through a channel for concurrent processing

4. **Concurrent Processing**:
   - Divides the dataset into chunks
   - Spawns multiple goroutines (default 4) to process data chunks in parallel
   - Uses a `sync.WaitGroup` to synchronize goroutine completion
   - Employs a buffered channel for signal collection to prevent blocking

5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - Main goroutine collects signals from all worker goroutines
   - Sorts signals into buy and sell categories
   - Prints aggregated results after all processing is complete

**Performance characteristics:**
- Execution time: ~2.3 seconds (may vary based on hardware and dataset size)
- Efficiently utilizes multiple CPU cores for parallel processing
- Scalable performance with larger datasets due to concurrent design

**Advantages:**
- Leverages Go's strong suit in concurrent programming
- Balances simplicity of implementation with performance optimization
- Easily scalable to handle larger datasets by adjusting the number of goroutines

**Potential for further optimization:**
- Fine-tuning the number of goroutines based on available CPU cores and dataset size
- Implementing more sophisticated workload balancing strategies
- Exploring alternative data structures for even faster processing

This implementation showcases Go's strength in creating efficient, concurrent programs with relatively simple and readable code. It demonstrates how Go can be effectively used for high-performance financial data processing tasks.



### Python Implementation

- Utilizes `pandas` for efficient data loading and manipulation
- Leverages `NumPy` for high-performance numerical computations
- Employs vectorized operations for SMA calculation and signal generation

**Key optimizations:**
- Uses `np.cumsum` for efficient cumulative sum calculation
- Employs boolean array operations for crossover detection
- Utilizes `np.where` for efficient signal index identification

**Execution time:** ~0.13 seconds
