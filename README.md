# Comparative Analysis of High-Performance Algorithmic Trading Implementations

## üìä Problem Statement

This project implements an Algorithmic Trading Simulator with Backtesting capabilities. The goal is to analyze historical stock price data, calculate moving averages, and generate buy/sell signals based on a simple moving average crossover strategy.

## üìà Dataset

The dataset used is historical stock price data for Meta (formerly Facebook), structured as follows:

timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
30-09-2022 04:00,136.82,136.82,136.82,136.82,100
30-09-2022 04:01,137.77,137.79,137.77,137.77,400
30-09-2022 04:05,137.59,137.59,137.59,137.59,100


- **Size**: 162,280 rows x 6 columns
- **Frequency**: Minute-by-minute trading data

## üßÆ Algorithm Overview

The core algorithm consists of two main components:

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA) Calculation**
   - Function: `calculateSMA`
   - Purpose: Calculates the average price over a specified period

2. **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**
   - Function: `movingAverageCrossover`
   - Signals:
     - Buy: Short-term SMA crosses above long-term SMA
     - Sell: Short-term SMA crosses below long-term SMA

## üíª Implementation in Different Languages

### C++ Implementation

Focuses on optimizing performance and memory usage:

- Uses `std::vector` for efficient data storage
- Employs `std::accumulate` for initial sum calculation in SMA
- Utilizes in-place vector operations to minimize memory allocations
- Implements efficient CSV parsing with minimal string operations

**Key optimizations:**
- Pre-allocation of vectors to avoid reallocation
- Use of references to avoid unnecessary copying
- Employs C++11 features for improved performance

**Execution time:** ~20 seconds

### Go Implementation

Leverages Go's simplicity and built-in features:

- Uses slices for data storage, similar to C++'s vectors
- Implements straightforward SMA and crossover calculations
- Utilizes Go's efficient built-in CSV parsing capabilities

**Note:** While not using goroutines in this implementation, Go's potential for concurrent processing is notable for larger datasets or more complex strategies.

**Execution time:** ~2.3 seconds

### Python Implementation

Showcases the power of specialized libraries:

- Utilizes `pandas` for efficient data loading and manipulation
- Leverages `NumPy` for high-performance numerical computations
- Employs vectorized operations for SMA calculation and signal generation

**Key optimizations:**
- Uses `np.cumsum` for efficient cumulative sum calculation
- Employs boolean array operations for crossover detection
- Utilizes `np.where` for efficient signal index identification

**Execution time:** ~0.13 seconds

## üèÅ Performance Comparison

| Language | Execution Time (s) | Key Advantages |
|----------|-------------------:|----------------|
| C++      | ~20                | Fine-grained control, potential for further optimization |
| Go       | ~2.3               | Good balance of performance and simplicity |
| Python   | ~0.13              | Fastest execution, leveraging optimized libraries |

## üîç Analysis

1. **C++ Performance**: 
   - Current implementation is slower than expected
   - Suggests potential for optimization in CSV parsing or memory management

2. **Go's Efficiency**: 
   - Provides a good balance between performance and code simplicity
   - Standard library and garbage collection contribute to clean, efficient code

3. **Python's Superiority**: 
   - Surprisingly outperforms due to highly optimized NumPy and pandas libraries
   - Libraries implement low-level, vectorized operations that outperform manual implementations

4. **Library vs. Manual Implementation**: 
   - Demonstrates the power of specialized, optimized libraries over manual implementations
   - NumPy and pandas libraries are written in C, offering C-like performance with Python's ease of use

5. **Potential for Improvement**: 
   - Both C++ and Go implementations could be optimized further
   - Possible improvements include implementing vectorized operations or leveraging parallel processing
